# Uploading Machine Learning Models to an Internet Computer (IC) Canister

This guide explains how to use the `ic-file-uploader` tool to upload a machine learning model file to an IC canister. The command breakdown is as follows:

## Command Example

```bash
ic-file-uploader icp_gpt2 append_model_bytes src/icp_gpt2/lib/models/gpt2_with_kv.onnx
```

````

### Breaking It Down:

1. **`ic-file-uploader`**
   This is the tool designed to upload large files, like machine learning models, to IC canisters. It handles chunking the file to bypass IC's message size limitations.

2. **`icp_gpt2`**
   This is the name of your target canister (smart contract) where the model will be stored.

3. **`append_model_bytes`**
   This is the method in the canister being invoked to append the model data in chunks.

4. **`src/icp_gpt2/lib/models/gpt2_with_kv.onnx`**
   This is the file path to the GPT-2 model that has been converted to ONNX format.

## Purpose of the Command

This command is used to:

1. Take a GPT-2 model that has been converted to ONNX format.
2. Upload the model in chunks to your IC canister.
3. Enable the model to be used for inference directly on the Internet Computer.

## Why Use `ic-file-uploader`?

The Internet Computer (IC) has message size limitations for canisters. Large files, like machine learning models, cannot be uploaded in a single message. The `ic-file-uploader` tool solves this by:

- Splitting the file into chunks.
- Appending these chunks to the canister using the `append_model_bytes` method.

---

## Post-Upload Step

After uploading the file, you need to initialize the uploaded model for use. Run the following command to complete the setup:

```bash
dfx canister call icp_gpt2 setup_model
```

This will configure the model within the canister for inference tasks.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Prepare the Model**
   Convert your GPT-2 model to ONNX format and place it in the appropriate path.

2. **Upload the Model**
   Run the `ic-file-uploader` command to upload the model in chunks.

3. **Initialize the Model**
   Use `dfx canister call` to initialize the uploaded model for use.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the `ic-file-uploader` tool is installed and properly configured.
- Verify the file path and canister name before executing the command.
- Large files may take some time to upload, depending on the chunk size and network speed.

This process enables you to leverage machine learning models directly on the Internet Computer, making it possible to use these models in decentralized applications.
