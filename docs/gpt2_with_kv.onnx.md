### What is `gpt2_with_kv.onnx`?

This file is a **pre-trained GPT-2 model** converted into the ONNX format. The ONNX format is an open standard that enables machine learning models to be interoperable across different frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others.

The `with_kv` in the name likely indicates that this version of GPT-2 supports **key-value caching**, which allows for faster inference by storing intermediate activations.

### Characteristics of the File

- **Model Architecture**: GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)
  - A large language model developed by OpenAI, trained to predict the next token in a sequence of text.
- **ONNX Format**: Allows the model to run on various platforms and frameworks.
- **Size**: Approximately 653.7 MB
  - This size suggests it is likely **GPT-2 Medium**, which has 345 million parameters.
- **Use Case**:
  - Text generation
  - Language modeling
  - Machine learning research or deployment on edge devices (if supported).

### Why Use ONNX?

The ONNX format is designed for efficiency and interoperability:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Can be used across frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or on edge devices with ONNX Runtime.
2. **Optimized Inference**: ONNX allows for model optimization and deployment in performance-critical environments like mobile or serverless computing.
3. **Flexibility**: Models can be quantized to reduce size and computational cost.

# GPT-2 Model in ONNX Format

This documentation explains the `gpt2_with_kv.onnx` file, its purpose, and how to use it in your project.

## File Details

- **File Name**: `gpt2_with_kv.onnx`
- **File Size**: 653.7 MB
- **Model Type**: GPT-2 (Medium, 345M parameters)
- **Format**: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)

## Purpose of the File

This file contains a GPT-2 model converted to the ONNX format, suitable for deployment in machine learning environments that support ONNX. It is optimized for:

- **Text Generation**: Generate human-like text completions.
- **Language Modeling**: Predict the next word/token in a sentence.
- **Custom Applications**: Use as a component in AI systems (e.g., chatbots, code generation).

The inclusion of **key-value caching (kv)** makes the model faster for inference, especially for longer input sequences.

## Why Use ONNX?

ONNX allows the GPT-2 model to be:

1. **Framework Agnostic**: Run the model on TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX Runtime without conversion.
2. **Optimized for Inference**: Supports hardware acceleration and platform-specific optimizations.
3. **Interoperable**: Seamlessly integrates into diverse ecosystems.

## How to Use the File

1. **Install ONNX Runtime**
   Ensure you have the ONNX Runtime installed to use the model:
   ```bash
   pip install onnxruntime
   ```
````

2. **Load the Model**
   Use ONNX Runtime to load the `gpt2_with_kv.onnx` file:

   ```python
   import onnxruntime as ort

   # Load ONNX model
   session = ort.InferenceSession("gpt2_with_kv.onnx")

   # Prepare input for the model
   inputs = {"input_ids": [[...]]}  # Add your input tensor here

   # Run inference
   outputs = session.run(None, inputs)
   print(outputs)
   ```

3. **Upload to Internet Computer Canister**
   To upload this model for use on the Internet Computer (IC), use the `ic-file-uploader` tool:

   ```bash
   ic-file-uploader icp_gpt2 append_model_bytes src/icp_gpt2/lib/models/gpt2_with_kv.onnx
   ```

   After uploading, initialize the model with:

   ```bash
   dfx canister call icp_gpt2 setup_model
   ```

4. **Optimize the Model**
   For better performance, you can quantize the model using ONNX optimization tools.

## Notes

- The model may require significant memory and processing power due to its size and parameter count.
- Ensure your deployment environment supports ONNX Runtime or a compatible inference engine.
